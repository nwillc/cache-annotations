Cache Annotations
=================
Implementation of JSR 107 cache annotations employing AspectJ aspects to weave in the caching. These annotations should
work for any JSR 107 compliant implementation, however I've only tested them with my own `SimpleCache` implementation.

A general note, adding caching without these annotations is pretty straight forward. These annotations, by there very
nature introduce overhead. Every affected method call requires a certain about of runtime investigation employing
reflection.  Usually caching is added for speed, so I'm not clear on the logic of avoiding some pretty straight forward
code at the cost of continuous overhead.
